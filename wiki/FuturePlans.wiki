Here in the alpha version 0.1, you can only define one web-enabled service method per class.  This is, of course, lame.  For the beta release, I'm planning to allow multiple web methods per web service class.

You will contribute the service to the dispatcher as normal and then access the method via

{{{http://myapp.example.org/id/<method-name>/arg1/arg2/...}}}
