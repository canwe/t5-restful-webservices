This Tapestry 5 contributed library enables services you write and define through the Tapestry 5 IoC to operate as RESTful web services.

This is done by writing a Tapestry 5 services that implement the {{{RestfulWS}}} interface in this module.  You then contribute these services to this library's {{{RestfulWSDispatcher}}} service by adding a contributeRestfulWSDispatcher method to your application's T5 IoC module.
